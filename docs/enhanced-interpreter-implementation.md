# Enhanced Claude Interpreter Implementation

## What We Built

### 1. Multi-Stage Interpretation Pipeline
- Enhanced prompt engineering with modifier detection
- Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for each interpretation
- Alternative interpretations when confidence is low

### 2. Smart Search Modifiers
- **Obscurity Detection**: "obscure", "rare", "deep cut" → filters by low popularity
- **Version Handling**: "original", "remix", "acoustic", "live" → smart version filtering
- **Exclusion Support**: Filters out unwanted versions (e.g., "NOT remix")

### 3. Popularity-Based Ranking
```typescript
// Obscure tracks get higher scores when user asks for "rare"
score *= (100 - popularity) / 100;

// Original versions preferred when specified
if (version === 'original' && trackName.includes('remaster')) {
  score *= 0.3; // Penalize remasters
}
```

### 4. Cultural Reference Support
- Basic cultural reference database (movie soundtracks, iconic scenes)
- Context enhancement for low-confidence queries
- Mood-to-search-term mapping

### 5. Enhanced Response Format
- Shows relevance scores for alternatives
- Includes interpretation confidence
- Displays enhanced query when modified

## How to Use

The enhanced interpreter is now the default at `/api/claude/command`. It handles:

1. **Obscure Track Requests**
   - "Play the most obscure Taylor Swift song"
   - "Find a rare Beatles B-side"

2. **Version Specifications**
   - "Play Long Live original version"
   - "Play Hurt NOT Johnny Cash version"

3. **Cultural References** (basic support)
   - "Play the song from the desert driving scene"
   - "Play that Breakfast Club ending song"

4. **Mood Queries** (basic support)
   - "Play something that sounds like rain"
   - "Play Sunday morning vibes"

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified
1. `/server/src/claude/enhanced-interpreter.ts` - Main enhanced interpreter
2. `/server/src/claude/web-search.ts` - Context enhancement utilities
3. `/server/src/spotify/control.ts` - Added search and queueTrackByUri methods
4. `/server/src/types/index.ts` - Added popularity field to SpotifyTrack

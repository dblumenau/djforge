      "output": "Nice to meet you, David. If you hate jazz, no problem—let’s steer clear of it. I can tailor things to your taste. Here are some easy options:\n\n- Build a playlist in non-jazz genres you like (rock, pop, electronic, hip-hop, indie, etc.).\n- Find music with a similar vibe to jazz elements but not actual jazz (jazz-adjacent or “soft” fusion) only if you’re curious.\n- Explore film/game soundtracks or mood playlists (chill, energetic, cinematic) that avoid jazz.\n- If you want to bridge the gap, I can propose a few tracks that use jazzy textures subtly and see if any spark interest (and you can opt out anytime).\n\nTell me a couple of artists or moods you enjoy (e.g., energetic, moody, upbeat, ambient, club, lyrical), and I’ll put together a non-jazz playlist right away.",

      "input": "Use your reasoning ability to explain why jazz is not for everyone",
      "output": "Sure—here are some reasons jazz isn’t for everyone, explained with nuance:\n\n- Improvisation can feel unpredictable: Jazz often emphasizes spontaneous soloing and flexible arrangements, which can come across as unpredictable or unsettled if you prefer fixed melodies and structures.\n\n- Complex harmony and rhythm: Jazz frequently uses advanced chord progressions, extended harmonies, and syncopated or swing rhythms. This can be harder to latch onto if you’re accustomed to straightforward pop/rock grooves.\n\n- Aesthetic and mood range: Jazz spans intimate ballads to high-energy, chaotic avant-garde. Not every listener wants the spectrum; some people prefer consistently bright, aggressive, or minimalist textures found outside jazz.\n\n- Cultural and historical distance: For some, jazz is tied to specific historical contexts, venues, or cultural associations that don’t resonate. This can make it feel less accessible or relevant.\n\n- Production and listening context: Jazz recordings and performances often reward careful, attentive listening (downtempo, polyphony, instrumental solos). If you listen mostly on quick playlists or in noisy environments, jazz can feel less immediately engaging.\n\n- Instrumentation and timbre: Jazz ensembles use a wide range of horns, rhythm sections, and acoustic textures. If you don’t connect with those sounds, you might tune out early.\n\n- Narrative expectations: Pop and rock often tell direct stories or present clear hooks. Jazz storytelling can be more abstract, instrumental, or mood-driven, which may not align with your listening preferences.\n\n- Accessibility of entry points: Some people try jazz through complex albums or long-form live performances first and feel overwhelmed. A lighter entry path (vocal jazz, simpler compositions, or jazz-influenced pop) can be more approachable.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this to your tastes and show where jazz might intersect with the kinds of music you already like (or propose non-jazz music that captures a similar vibe).",
